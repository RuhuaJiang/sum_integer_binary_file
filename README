Calculate the sum of values stored in a user-specified binary file. The sum is limited to 64-bit precision.

The program can be provided only one argument, the path to the binary file
containing the list of integers. The binary file consists of an array of
little-endian 32-bit unsigned integers.

The program can handle input files consisting of more than one billion
integers. 

The test input file littleEndian1000 is a binary file contains integer from 0 to 999.
